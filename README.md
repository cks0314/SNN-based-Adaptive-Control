# 1. Spiking neural network-based adaptive control of serial manipulator robots with online learning
We will evaluate the performance of two neural network architectures, one based on nonlinear sigmoid activation functions and the other based on the Leaky integrate and fire (LIF) activation function. 
## Contributions:
- Formulation of a Lyapunov-based adaptation and control law for online learning for serial manipulators
- Comparison of the learning performance of conventional MPL and CNN with spiking neural network
